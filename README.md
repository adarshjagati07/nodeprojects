# Node Projects
1.) Command LIne Chat app.<br>
2.) The Message Board<br>

## CLI-Chat app
Inside this repository i have added some basic project of network programming. (Initially a Command Line Chat app).

I am building this app as a command line chat app, in this app there is no graphical user interface users can interact with each other using command line.
By using multiple tabs as a way of logging in.<br>
I have created a separate terminal window which is to be shown by monitor.js, which works as a monitor screen to show- Notifications, messages and broadcast);<br>
User have to open two command prompts(one for client side command access and one for its output i.e. monitor screen).<br>
In one command prompt our server is running which will send response that has been asked by the client.<br>

## Message Board

This is a basic app which is going to use the server created by me. (AJHttpServer)<br>
Main Aim of this project is to to test my Server and enrich it with all the requirements possible to create a good web server.<br>
I am going to give it functionalites of login signup, Admin and user support, and all the CRUD related functionatlites.  <br>

Though i have made some changes over here from my previous server. Firstly I'll test them over here then implement in the main server.

# nodeprojects
Inside this repository i have added some basic project of network programming. (Initially a Command Line Chat app).
#CLI_CHAT_APP
I am building this app as a command line chat app, in this app there is no graphical user interface users can interact with each other using command line.
By using multiple tabs as a way of logging in.
I have created a separate terminal window which is to be shown by monitor.js, which works as a monitor screen to show- Notifications, messages and broadcast);
User have to open two command prompts(one for client side command access and one for its output i.e. monitor screen).
In one command prompt our server is running which will send response that has been asked by the client.
